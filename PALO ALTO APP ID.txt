Now at this point of time if we go to the client pc and try to accesss
www.youtube.com
www.google.com
www.facebook.com
we'll be able to access it.

Now to see how the app id works will try to block everything except for www.youtube.com

We'll go to the same policy we had created earlier i.e
INSIDE-TO-OUTSIDE
Application
add
youtube-base
the moment you select youtube-base you'll see that 
youtube-base depends on google-base and we also need to add 
it to the current rule or else we won't be able to access
youtube
ok
COMMIT
Now when you go to the client pc you'll only be able to access
www.youtube.com
www.google.com
and not www.facebook.com

DONE!!
